# OpenAPI docs
A directory to be used for OpenAPI specifications used by the security industry. Some are made by me, while other's are contributed or gathered by others. 

[OpenAPI website](https://www.openapis.org/)

## Why?
The security industry is in need standardization on the API front, and I thought this might be a good place to start. OpenAPI definitions are usually well hidden on vendors' websites where I've dug some of them up, before adding them here.

## About
I'm working on an [automation platform](https://shuffler.io) that leverages OpenAPI rather than any proprietary, code specific ecosystem to prevent the lockin issues with current SOAR products. It's also based on nsacyber's [WALKOFF](https://github.com/nsacyber/walkoff), and should be working well with their platform in the future as well. If the "info" section is wrong, please tell me. I had a bug in the past that rewrote it to my name for every single one.

## Goal
Not having to write custom python code for everything I automate anymore
