For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).


        When an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store the item's content or configuration details. For more information on working with dashboard items, see [ Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/) and the [Dashboard Item](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/dashboard-item/) documentation.

        #### Context variables ####


        The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.

         *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
         *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The Connect app that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
         *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
         *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
         *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
         *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
         *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
         *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
         *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.  

        Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).

      description: >-
        Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is
        used:

         *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
         *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

        For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would be returned.


        Optionally, the search can be refined to:

         *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:

             *  issue types.
            
            If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
         *  not return Connect app users and groups.

        Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or
        subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue
        properties set.


        The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.


        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the parent and child are members of the same project. In a classic project the parent field is only valid for subtasks.

        An issue cannot be deleted if it has one or more subtasks. To delete an issue with subtasks, set `deleteSubtasks`. This causes the issue's subtasks to be deleted with the issue.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *Browse projects* and *Delete issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project containing the issue.
         *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

        does not have the *Edit Issues* permission but has the *Assign issue*
        permission for the project that the issue is in.


        If `name` or `accountId` is set to:

         *  `"-1"`, the issue is assigned to the default assignee for the project.
         *  `null`, the issue is set to unassigned.

      description: >-
        Adds one or more attachments to an issue. Attachments are posted as
        multipart/form-data ([RFC 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)).


        Note that:

         *  The request must have a `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header, if not it is blocked. See [Special headers](#special-request-headers) for more information.
         *  The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains the attachments must be `file`.

        The following example uploads a file called *myfile.txt* to the issue *TEST-123*:


        `curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: no-check" -F "file=@myfile.txt" https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123/attachments`


        Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes for handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java, the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) class for multipart POST operations.

      description: >-
        Loads an avatar for the issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request. Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST \ --user email@example.com:<api_token> \ --header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' \ --header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' \ --data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" \ --url 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/{issueTypeId}'This`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified, the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar, use [ Update issue type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.

        Returns a list of permissions indicating which permissions the user has.
        Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in a global, project,
        or issue context.


        The user is reported as having a project permission:

         *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.
         *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.
         *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.

        This means that users may be shown as having an issue permission (such as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a project context but may not have the permission for any or all issues. For example, if Reporters have the EDIT\_ISSUES permission a user would be shown as having this permission in the global context or the context of a project, because any user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES permission for that issue.


        Global permissions are unaffected by context.

        ### About notification schemes ###


        A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

         *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
         *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
            
             *  `CurrentAssignee`
             *  `Reporter`
             *  `CurrentUser`
             *  `ProjectLead`
             *  `ComponentLead`
             *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
             *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
             *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
             *  `EmailAddress`
             *  `AllWatchers`
             *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
             *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

        *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses.*


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

        ### About permission schemes and grants ###


        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.


        #### Holder object ####


        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

         *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
         *  `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

         *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
         *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
         *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
         *  `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
         *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
         *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
         *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
         *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
         *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
         *  `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used).
         *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

        #### Built-in permissions ####


        The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

      summary: Update permission scheme
      description: >-
        Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note
        when using this resource:

         *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
         *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
         *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

        If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of updating the whole list, see [Create permission grant](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post) or [Delete permission scheme entity](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete).


        See [About permission schemes and grants](#about-permission-schemes) for more details.

      description: >-
        Loads an avatar for a project.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request. Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified, the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use [Set project avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.

        ### About project roles ###


        [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).


        Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.


        #### Members and actors ####


        In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.


        Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:

         *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
         *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

      summary: Load avatar
      description: >-
        Loads a custom avatar for a project or issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request. Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/type/{type}/owner/{entityId}'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified, the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use:

         *  [Update issue type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.
         *  [Set project avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.
